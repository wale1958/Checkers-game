Needs Work | WebSockets infrastructure substantially lacking (0-9) | Code is very difficult to read/comprehend (0-9) | Javadoc, in-line comments, and/or "Works Cited" are minimal or missing.  (0-9)          |  Code doesn't run; program substantially fails to meet specs. (0-10)            |

90. Almost working! I have trouble moving pieces, though, and probably some more messages classes are needed to make the full game.
